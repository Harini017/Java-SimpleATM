🔐 SimpleATM – Java Console Application
Description:

The SimpleATM project is a Java-based console application that simulates core ATM functionalities such as user authentication, balance inquiry, cash deposit, and withdrawal. Designed for intermediate-level developers, this project demonstrates the practical use of object-oriented programming (OOP), modular design, and basic data structures in Java.

🛠 Key Features:
Login Authentication: Validates user by account number and PIN

Check Balance: Displays the current balance of the logged-in user

Deposit Money: Allows secure addition of funds to the account

Withdraw Money: Verifies sufficient balance before deduction

Transaction History: Optionally stores and shows last transactions

Menu-based Navigation: Console interface with numbered options for each operation

📁 Project Structure:
model/Account.java – Represents account details (account number, PIN, balance)

service/ATMService.java – Contains the core ATM logic (login, menu, operations)

util/Transaction.java – [Optional] Handles transaction records

ATMApp.java – Main class to run the application

🔧 Technologies Used:
Java 8+

IntelliJ IDEA (recommended IDE)

Git (for version control)

📌 Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on practice with Java OOP

Implementing HashMaps for in-memory account data

Designing a modular application structure

Applying basic authentication logic

Working with console input/output
