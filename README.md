# Java-SimpleATM
The SimpleATM project is a Java-based console application that simulates core ATM functionalities such as user authentication, balance inquiry, cash deposit, and withdrawal. Designed for intermediate-level developers, this project demonstrates the practical use of object-oriented programming (OOP), modular design, and basic data structures in Java.
